This program is a simple Breakout game that was made utilizing the cocos2d-x cross platform open source 2d game engine (http://www.cocos2d-x.org).

It was written in C++ so that it could run on Android phones as well as Iphones.  I removed all the resource files I used in this game due to copyright reasons.
