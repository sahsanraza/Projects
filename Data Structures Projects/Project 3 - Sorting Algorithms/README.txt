Assignment 3: Comparing Sorting Methods

Date: October 20, 2010

Introductory Comments:

The code included is a method that performs selection sort on an array of objects, 
a method that performs merge sort on an array of objects, and a method that performs
quick sort on an array of objects.  The code works with Dr. Aronis's driver which I 
provided.  



Files: SortingMethods.java, SortingMethods.class, CompareSortingMethods.java, CompareSortingMethods.class,
TestSort.java, TestSort.class

How to run program: 

Run the CompareSortingMethods file to test my code with Dr. Aronis's driver.  I also provided a small test
file called TestSort.java that tests my code on an array of Strings. 


Problems:  

The only problem is that you will recieve a few warnings when you compile my SortingMethods.java because of
the Generics but it will still compile and work.
