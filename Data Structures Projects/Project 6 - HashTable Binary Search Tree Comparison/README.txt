Assignment 6: Hash Table vs. Binary Search Tree

Date: December 2, 2010

Introductory Comments:

	For this project I had to implement two data structures: the Hash Table and the
Binary Search Tree.  I created two new classes to represent items entered into the Hash Table
and Binary Search Tree.  I use the Entry class for the Hash Table and the Node class for the Binary Search Tree.  
The Hash Table is based on an array and the Binary Search Tree is based on a bunch of Nodes that have 
refrences to one another.


Files: 
	HashTable.java, HashTable.class, Entry.java, Entry.class, BinarySearchTree.java, 
BinarySearchTree.class, Node.java, Node.class, CompareAlgorithms.java, CompareAlgorithms.class, README.txt

How to run program: 

	To run the program just run the driver CompareAlgorithms.class.  This is the driver Dr. Aronis provided us.


Problems:  
	
	I had no problems with my code.  It runs perfectly.
