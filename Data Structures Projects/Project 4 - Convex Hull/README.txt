Assignment 4: Convex Hull & The Graham Scan

Date: November 7, 2010

Introductory Comments:

	This program is meant to find the convex hull of a set of randomly generated points.  It also displays
the points and convex hull on screen.  There is a test file included that calls all the necessary methods in the
correct order so that the convex hull can be found.   



Files: Point.java, Point.class, Graph.java, Graph.class, ConvexHull.java, ConvexHull.class, Test.java, Test.class

How to run program: 

	To run the program just run the file Test.class.  The test file has a variable called POINTS that allows
you to change the number of points generated if you wanted to.

Problems:  

	The only problem I've had with my program is that rarely it does not find the convex hull correctly and
ends up enclosing only some of the points on screen and not all of them.  But the majority of the time it works
correctly and does find the convex hull.
