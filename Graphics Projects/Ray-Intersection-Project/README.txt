Comments:

This program was written using Ubuntu Linux 12.04.

Included is a make file that will compile the program.  

Spec files should be placed in the same folder as the executable so that when it
prompts you to enter the file name, the program will be able to find it.

To see the rays that are drawn after you click on the screen you need to move the camera
left or right since the ray is coming straight from the camera's point of view.

There is no support for the house object because I was told that was not required.  So in the spec files
used to test this project there shouldn't be any lines beginning with the number 2.
Number 1 is cube, 3 is sphere, 4 is cylinder, and 5 is cone according to my program.

Extra Credit:

I added a shrink ray and grow ray to my program.  If you press '1' on the keyboard and shoot an object
then it will shrink in size.  If you press '2' on the keyboard and shoot an object then it will grow in
size.
