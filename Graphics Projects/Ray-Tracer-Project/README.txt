Comments:

This program was written using Ubuntu Linux 12.04.

Included is a make file that will compile the program.  

Spec files should be placed in the same folder as the executable so that when it
prompts you to enter the file name, the program will be able to find it.

The spec file I used to test my program is called test.txt and is provided.

RayTracerexample.png is an image I captured of my program raytracing with the test.txt spec file.

I color the background of the image pink in my ray tracer so that the shapes will stand out more.

When I run my ray tracer on my crappy Laptop (AMD Turion II Dual-Core Mobile M500 2.2 GHz) it takes around 
3 seconds for the image to be drawn.  So you should be able to test it without any waiting.

Bugs:

None that I am aware of.
